The above link provides the ability to send requests to the service, the files included are the same as those in the 
resources folder, so using curl with the endpoints describes in QuestionnaireController will yield the same results, if
that is preferred. 


## Notes
The design of the questionnaire I have provided allows for nested subsections on true or false answer responses, boolean
responses, text responses and custom true/false labels for boolean questions.

Given more time I would like to have added additional tests, better error handling in the api, authentication, database 
support, autogenerated answers from pre-existing user data (eg. gender age etc.) and nlp/regex
matching to identify high risk text answers.
